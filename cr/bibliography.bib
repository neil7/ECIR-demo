              build a knowledge base of interlinked results. Specifically, we
              consider two main tasks: extracting results and their proofs from
              the PDFs of scientific articles and establishing which results are
              used in the proofs of others across the scientific literature. We
              discuss the problem statement, methodologies, and preliminary
              findings employed in both phases of our approach, highlighting the
              challenges faced.",
